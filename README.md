## 👋 About Me

I am a **Manual Mobile QA Tester / Automation Enthusiast** with experience in the **banking sector**, working in a regulated, enterprise environment where quality and reliability are critical.

My professional background includes **JavaScript, React, and the MERN stack**, which helps me understand applications from the inside and design better, more effective tests.

Alongside my manual testing work, I actively develop my skills in **test automation**, focusing on:
- **E2E automation with Playwright**
- **Mobile test automation for iOS & Android using Appium (in progress)**

My goal is to grow into a **Test Automation Engineer**, combining strong manual testing foundations with scalable automation solutions.
